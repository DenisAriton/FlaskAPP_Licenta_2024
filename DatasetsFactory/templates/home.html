                            <span>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</span> A dataset is an organized collection of information,
                            often arranged in table form, where each row represents a record and each column represents a characteristic of that record.
                            Datasets can contain various types of data, such as numbers, text, images, sounds, or other forms of information.
                            Datasets in general are organized as follows: data for training and for testing.

                            <span>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</span> Machine learning models learn relationships and patterns from data,
                            adjusting their parameters to minimize prediction error.
                            Without data, a model cannot learn and therefore cannot make useful predictions.

                            <h5 class="subtitle-content">Testing</h5>
                            <span>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</span> After training, the models are evaluated on data not seen during training (test data)
                            to check how well they generalize to new data.
                            Validation data is used during model development to adjust hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

                            <span>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</span>  Quality and relevance of data sets are critical.
                            The data must be representative of the problem the model is trying to solve.
                            Noisy or irrelevant data can lead to ineffective or erroneous models.
                            The data must also be clean, for example free of significant errors or omissions.

                            through which you can get access on a dataset and load it into your AI app just with a call.

                            pip install DatasetsFactory. After the library was installed, now you have to do some initializations:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Get the token access from your profile page!</li>
                                <li>Import the <code>DatasetsFactory</code> module into your python module!</li>
                                   ~ <code>from DatasetsFactory import Datasets</code> ~
                            </ol>
